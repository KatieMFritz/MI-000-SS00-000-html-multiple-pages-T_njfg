    <h1>My fake DS9 fansite</h1>
    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p>This is a quick site I threw together to practice HTML pages and routing. It is nominally about <em>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</em>.</p>
    <h2>So are you a fake fan?</h2>
    <p>No, I'm a real fan. It's just not a real fansite.</p>
